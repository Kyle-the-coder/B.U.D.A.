B.U.D.A. is Bianca's Urban Dance Academy and this is the website that I built for her company. It is made in React using JavaScript as the front-end and Firebase as the back-end. The website is decorated with videos and images of her students so that you can feel the energy from the studio pop right off the screen! I also added a client-side cms which allows the client to edit portions of the website on the fly for quick, responsive, and easy content management. The site is live at budamarin.com if you want to check it out, below I will be showing the CMS that I have created which can only be accessed by the client.

-To start here is the landing page, I am showing this to give perspective of what an average person viewing the site would see. I used Tailwind CSS to style the site. I went with a more standard layout to make it easy and concise to find the info you may want as a potential customer of B.U.D.A.

-This is what the client side CMS looks like after they have put in their login info. Their info is stored locally as a JWT Token to authorize the correct user as well as give them more security in the access of their website. I went with a sidebar to hold the forms that can edit the content. When a form is clicked the related content on the site is highlighted with a red border to indicate which piece of the site that form is editing.

-Along the way I found that it was hard to see the form and the content you were wanting to edit, so I created the ability to shrink the site down in a "birds-eye" fashion. This allows the client to quickly see what is being edited while being able to look at the form at the same time.

-To further this concept I added more "highlights" to bigger forms so the client can really see what they are editing and while they are editing, they can see the content change in real time to help further the decesion process when the client is editing their site.

-I also gave the client the ability to edit the banner videos (which also can be images) at the top of each page for a quick customizable and personal touch that can be added to the website by the client. As new content comes in the client can update their own website quick and easy.

-The client wanted a few extra features such as an email form, google maps location, and a password protected page that the client gives to certain memmbers of her business. I created a way for the client to add dropbox links to continually update those specific members on music, videos, or information that those specific members need. The password protected page also uses a JWT to allow the user to swith between pages without having to sign back in.

the next video shows how the client uses the client-side CMS to add a link to her exclusive member page

-Lastly when the client is done editing parts of their site, they can logout, which will log them out of their JWT Token and they can see where the edits have been made. All of this can be done while the site is live and all edits are applied instantly.

I created this site for my client to have a beautiful and customizable experience with their online presence. I want my client to feel like it's their website, that they have control over the content and overall expression that brings their site to life. Thank you for taking to the time to look at my project, again the site is live you can see it here: budamarin.com, thank you!
