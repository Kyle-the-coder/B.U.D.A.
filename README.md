B.U.D.A. is Bianca's Urban Dance Academy and this is the website that I built for her company. It is made in React using JavaScript as the front-end and Firebase as the back-end. The website is decorated with videos and images of her students so that you can feel the energy from the studio pop right off the screen! I also added a client-side cms which allows the client to edit portions of the website on the fly for quick, responsive, and easy content management. The site is live at budamarin.com if you want to check it out, below I will be showing the CMS that I have created which can only be accessed by the client.


-To start here is the landing page, I am showing this to give perspective of what an average person viewing the site would see. I used Tailwind CSS to style the site. I went with a more standard layout to make it easy and concise to find the info you may want as a potential customer of B.U.D.A.

-This is what the client side CMS looks like after they have put in their login info. Their info is stored locally as a JWT Token to authorize the correct user as well as give them more security in the access of their website. I went with a sidebar to hold the forms that can edit the content. When a form is clicked the related content on the site is highlighted with a red border to indicate which piece of the site that form is editing.
