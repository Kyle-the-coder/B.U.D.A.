B.U.D.A. is an acronym for Bianca's Urban Dance Academy, a professional dance academy. I had the privilege of developing their website, which was built using React for the front-end and JavaScript, while Firebase serves as the reliable back-end. The website showcases a vibrant collection of videos and images featuring the talented students, exuding the energy and dynamism of the academy right through the screen.

To ensure seamless content management, I implemented a client-side content management system (CMS), allowing the client to make quick and responsive edits to various sections of the website. This empowers them to maintain an up-to-date online presence effortlessly. I'm excited to share that the website is live and accessible at budamarin.com, where you can explore the result of this collaboration.

Allow me to provide you with a tour of the CMS that I have created, exclusively accessible to the client:

1. Landing Page: To provide an understanding of the user's perspective, I'd like to begin with the landing page. It follows a standardized layout, meticulously styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring easy navigation and concise access to relevant information for potential customers of B.U.D.A. Here's a video to provide a glimpse:

2. Client-Side CMS: Upon logging in with their authorized credentials, the client gains access to the user-friendly CMS. The login information is securely stored locally as a JSON Web Token (JWT), ensuring user authentication and enhanced security measures for accessing their website. The CMS features a sidebar housing various forms to edit content. When a form is selected, the corresponding section on the site is highlighted with a red border, providing a visual indication of the edited content. Please refer to this video for a visual representation:

3. Bird's-Eye View: To optimize the editing experience, I incorporated a "birds-eye" view, allowing the client to shrink the site and view it as a whole. This facilitates simultaneous examination of the form and the associated content, enabling quick assessments. Here's a quick demonstration of this feature:

4. Real-Time Feedback: Understanding the importance of informed decision-making during the editing process, I implemented additional highlights for significant forms. These highlights offer enhanced visibility, and any changes made in real-time are immediately reflected in the displayed content. Here's a video illustrating this functionality:

5. Banner Customization: To provide a personalized touch, the client has the capability to edit the banner videos (which can also include images) at the top of each page. This feature enables them to add a quick, customizable element that aligns with their vision. Additionally, as new content becomes available, the client can effortlessly update their website. Please refer to this image for a better understanding:

6. Additional Features: Based on the client's requirements, I incorporated several additional features, including an email form, Google Maps location integration, and a password-protected page for specific members of the business. To streamline communication, I integrated Dropbox links, allowing the client to continually update designated members with relevant music, videos, or information. The password-protected page utilizes a JWT, enabling seamless navigation between pages without the need for repeated sign-ins. Here's an image showcasing these features:

7. Logout and Site Visibility: To conclude the editing process, the client can log out, effectively terminating their JWT session. This provides them with a comprehensive overview of the edits they have made. Notably, all changes take effect instantly, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience. Here's an image showcasing this feature:

I created this site for my client to have a beautiful and customizable experience with their online presence. I want my client to feel like it's their website, that they have control over the content and overall expression that brings their site to life. Thank you for taking to the time to look at my project.
